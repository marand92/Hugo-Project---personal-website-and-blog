<p>Hello! I&rsquo;m Mario André, a passionate and enthusiastic business analyst currently making waves at 50Hertz, one of Germany&rsquo;s key transmission system operators. My journey in the world of business analysis and process optimization has been nothing short of exciting, and I&rsquo;m thrilled to share a bit about my professional story with you.</p>

</h3>
<p>At 50Hertz, I have the privilege of working with a dynamic, eight-member software development team where we&rsquo;re on a mission to transform the way we manage energy accounting and settlement processes. Our work is all about blending the old with the new—taking legacy systems from the 90s and integrating them with the latest in modern technology. It’s a challenging yet deeply rewarding task, and I love every minute of it.</p>
<p>What drives me every day is the ability to work in an environment that truly lives and breathes agility. Our team’s agile approach allows us to adapt quickly, pivot when needed, and continuously improve our software to meet ever-evolving requirements. We&rsquo;re not just a team; we&rsquo;re pioneers within 50Hertz, setting the standard for others by demonstrating how innovation and adaptability can lead to success.</p>

  My Journey So Far

</h3>
<p>Before joining 50Hertz, I had the opportunity to work in various roles that shaped my skills and perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ecoworks</strong>: As a Business Process Specialist in the Operational Excellence team, I helped implement a workflow tool and automated a digital evaluation platform. This project was critical in allowing the company to accurately estimate whether buildings could be upgraded to net-zero standards—an achievement that aligned perfectly with my passion for sustainability and innovation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leipa</strong>: At this industrial paper company, I worked as a Process Engineer in the Business Development Team. Here, I played a significant role in the implementation of SAP as the company&rsquo;s ERP system. I also managed the launch of an on-demand timeslot booking system, complete with real-time waiting time estimates and a smart queuing algorithm. This system revolutionized how we handled the hundreds of trucks arriving daily at our facility, improving efficiency and reducing bottlenecks.</p>
</li>
</ul>

    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>I thrive on solving complex problems and turning challenges into opportunities for growth. Whether it&rsquo;s diving deep into the requirements for energy settlement processes or finding innovative ways to streamline operations, I approach every task with enthusiasm and a desire to make a real impact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just about getting the job done; I&rsquo;m about getting it done right. My experience across different industries—from startups to large industrial companies—has taught me the importance of adaptability, collaboration, and continuous learning. I&rsquo;m always eager to embrace new ideas, take on difficult challenges, and work with teams that share my commitment to excellence.</p>
