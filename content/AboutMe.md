## About Me

Hello! I'm Mario, a passionate and enthusiastic business process specialist currently working for 50Hertz, one of Germany's energy grid operators. My journey in the world of business analysis and process optimization has been full of twists and to me is a journey of continuied learning from and for the purpose.

### My Role at 50Hertz

At my current role as a Business Analyst in a eight-head software dev team, where we're on a mission to transform the way we manage energy grid settlement. Our work is all about blending the old legacy processes with the our new systems, updating 90s to modern possibilities while not fogetting that looking deeply into its history is well worth it. It’s a challenging yet deeply rewarding task, and I love every other minute of it.

### My Journey So Far

Before joining 50Hertz, I had the opportunity to work in various roles that shaped my skills and perspective:

- **Ecoworks**: As a Business Process Specialist in the Operational Excellence team, I helped implement a workflow tool and automated a digital evaluation platform. This project was critical in allowing the company to accurately estimate whether buildings could be upgraded to net-zero standards—an achievement that aligned perfectly with my passion for sustainability and innovation.
  
- **As a small business founder**: Starting Oktavi.de, a musical instrument rental service, was great learn about responsibilities, possibilities and self-awareness for me. At one point business got to big to be handled part-time and too small to feed the two of us in the mid-term, so I left and my brother kept it going. I did most of my work for Oktavi part-time, while I was working at Leipa.

- **Leipa**: At this industrial paper company, I worked as a Process Engineer in the Business Development Team. Here, I played a significant role in the implementation of SAP as the company's ERP system. I also managed the launch of an on-demand timeslot booking system, complete with real-time waiting time estimates and a smart queuing algorithm. This system revolutionized how we handled the hundreds of trucks arriving daily at our facility, improving efficiency and reducing bottlenecks.

### Why I Love What I Do

I thrive on solving complex problems and turning challenges into opportunities for growth. Whether it's diving deep into the requirements for energy settlement processes or finding innovative ways to streamline operations, I approach every task with enthusiasm and a desire to make a real impact.

I'm not just about getting the job done; I'm about getting it done right. My experience across different industries—from startups to large industrial companies—has taught me the importance of adaptability, collaboration, and continuous learning. I'm always eager to embrace new ideas, take on difficult challenges, and work with teams that share my commitment to excellence.

### Let's Connect

I'm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and conversations about how we can push the boundaries of what's possible. If you’re looking for someone who’s deeply passionate about process improvement, innovation, and driving meaningful change, let’s get in touch!
