## Legacy System Revamp at 50Hertz
At 50Hertz, the transmission system operator, I am involved in **transforming a legacy accounting platform** that managed critical energy settlement processes. Their system is 90s code, largely undocumented, and based on outdated Java, posing several challenges:

- The system was a **black box**—users had no visibility into the processes and calculations, implemented in the 30+ years of usage
- Team inefficiencies and hierarchical structures hindered progress, a poor feedback process and resentment towards the lead of the team

**Solution**:
We introduced **automated process modeling** using Neo4J, which allowed us to visualize previously hidden database relationships. This tool helped us identify and streamline legacy processes, cut out deprecated parts, and surface inefficiencies.

**Outcome**:
Based on these insights, management tasked me and a colleague with forming a new **cross-functional team** to build an MVP for a new accounting tool, later onboarding our new PO, and three other internal developers. We are on track to deliver this MVP ahead of the October 1st 2024 deadline, improving both user experience and system efficiency. This project not only improved internal processes but also demonstrated the **feasibility of modernizing** an essential, long-standing system to modern industry standards.

Throughout the project, I learned invaluable lessons in **conflict management**, **rapid decision-making**, and **adapting to complex organizational dynamics**. It reinforced my belief in using modern, agile approaches to transform even the most challenging legacy systems.

## Time-Slot Management App at LEIPA Group
Over a period of 1.5 years at LEIPA, I led a project to overhaul an inefficient implementation of the **Transporeon SaaS timeslot management system**. This system was used to coordinate the entry of 250+ trucks daily through three factory gates.

**Initial Issues**:
- The timeslot system was disconnected from real-time truck data.
- There was no feedback loop to adjust for delays, early arrivals or no-shows.
- The system lacked prioritization based on punctuality or demand peaks.

**Solution**:
We redefined the system to ensure a high likelihood of factory entry within a booked slot, based on truck arrival times. I led a team of external developers to build a backend system, integrated with the yard management frontend, and developed a **mobile app** for truck drivers. We incorporated real-time data, including truck arrival history, geofencing, and capacity predictions, to create a **dynamic timeslot shifting algorithm**.

**Outcome**:
- The new system provided truck drivers with real-time updates on their queue position and remaining wait time through the app. (!) A huge change for waiting drivers, who could now shower & pee while waiting, conveniently seeing their remaining waiting time on the phone, anywhere around the parking lots.
- **15-minute reduction** in lead time per truck.
- Increased transparency and fairness in truck handling, with a reward system for punctuality.

This project, to me, demonstrated the critical difference between simply implementing software and **leveraging the full potential** implementing an actually smart customization to the standard to deliver tangible operational improvements.

## SAP Implementation at LEIPA Group

As the subproject manager for the **logistics and warehousing component** of the SAP Procurement implementation at LEIPA Group's Schwedt factory, my role was crucial in ensuring the project's success. The implementation followed a structured approach:

1. **Blueprinting Phase**: We conducted a comprehensive **legacy analysis** to assess the wide range of tools and historically developed processes in use. Many of these legacy systems were inefficient and uncoordinated, making this step critical for shaping a streamlined solution.
   
2. **Customizing Phase**: We identified several **quick-win improvements**. Notably, we enhanced **automated reporting** for key ramp shift managers, providing them with real-time data for more informed decision-making. Additionally, we developed a **three-day procurement forecasting tool** to better predict production and material capacity needs. This tool allowed for a better coordination across departments, eliminating misaligned forecasts.
   
**Key Achievement**: Despite the resignation of the previous subproject manager, who believed meeting the deadline wasn´t anymore impossible, I took over and led the team consiting of five internal stakeholders, three external consultants and two SAP programmers to not only meet the deadline but also achieve an **almost smooth Go-Live phase** without a high-impact production stop. This accomplishment showcased the strength of our collaboration.
